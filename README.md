# ADN-Sequences
## Overview

### Project: Generation and Detection of DNA Sequences

This project focuses on the generation and detection of specific DNA sequences that repeat within a nucleotide chain. The system is designed to generate DNA sequences based on the following parameters:

* Number of Sequences: The total number of sequences to be generated.
* Maximum Sequence Length: The maximum allowed length for each generated sequence.
* Base Generation Probability: The probability assigned to the occurrence of each type of base (adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine) in the generated sequences.
* Pattern Size: The length of the patterns to be identified and detected within the DNA chain.
The project's objective is to provide an effective tool for simulating and analyzing DNA sequences, facilitating the identification of specific patterns and repetitions for various biological and genetic applications.
